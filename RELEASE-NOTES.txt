Joda-Time version 2.6
---------------------

Joda-Time is a date and time handling library that seeks to replace the JDK
Date and Calendar classes.

This release contains enhancements, bug fixes and a time zone update.
The release runs on JDK 5 or later.

Joda-Time is licensed under the business-friendly Apache License Version 2.
This is the same license as all of Apache, plus other open source projects such as Spring.
The intent is to make the code available to the Java community with the minimum
of restrictions. If the license causes you problems please contact the mailing list.

Enhancements since 2.5
----------------------
- Added new system property for time-zone loading [#37]
  Added system property "org.joda.time.DateTimeZone.Folder".
  If set, then it is treated as a file system folder to load time-zone data from.
  The folder is loaded using ZoneInfoProvider and must be the unzipped output of ZoneInfoCompiler.
  The default behaviour is unchanged, with default time-zone data included in the jar file.

- Produce jar file without time-zone data [#220]
  A second jar file is now located in Maven Central with the classifier "no-tzdb".
  This is the same as the main joda-time jar file, except that the tzdb data and ZoneInfoCompiler are omitted.
  This is intended for use by Android, but could be used in other environments.
  If using this alternative jar, a time-zone system property must be set, either
  "org.joda.time.DateTimeZone.Provider" or "org.joda.time.DateTimeZone.Folder".
  The default behaviour in the standard jar file is unchanged, with time-zone data included in the jar file.

Binary compatible - Yes

Source compatible - Yes

Serialization compatible - Yes

Data compatible - Yes, except

Deprecations since 2.5
----------------------


Bug fixes since 2.5
-------------------
- Handle complex prefix/suffix combinations [#194, #203]
  For example, 'M' for months and 'm' for minutes.
  Parser is generally case insensitive, but handles this specific case sensitivity

- Attempt to tackle an Android deadlock [#196]
  Use dedicated lock objects instead of locking on the class object

- Fix name provider [#176]
  Name provider relied on tzdb short names matching JDK data names
  This has ceased to be true due to recent changes in tzdb, so changed to a different algorithm
  Data returned still depends on the JDK data, not the tzdb
  Thus, tzdb may say AEST for Sydney Australia, but if the JDK still has EST, then that is what you get

- Fix time-zone compilation tests


Scala
--------
Joda-Time uses annotations from Joda-Convert.
In the Java programming language, this dependency is optional, however in Scala it is not.
Scala users must manually add the Joda-Convert v1.2 dependency.
